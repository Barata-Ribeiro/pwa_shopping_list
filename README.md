# My Shopping List

## üåê Description

A progressive web application (PWA) designed for users to maintain a shopping list. Instead of using paper, you can use your phone and simply write the product, to remind you what to buy. Originally inspired by a [freeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFD4SP91tSM), this project was enhanced to cater to individual user needs instead of personal usage. It includes:

- Firebase Rules that ensure unique list per user
- Google Login/Logout functionality
- Loading spinners for better user experience
- Enhanced error handling

Hopefully some future implementations will include a theme switcher and more...

You can find the demo here > [Demo](https://pwa-shopping-list.vercel.app/)

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

1. Clone the project from the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Barata-Ribeiro/pwa_shopping_list.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd pwa_shopping_list
   ```

3. Install the required packages (If you're using npm or any other package manager):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Keep in mind that if you plan on running this application yourself, you will have to create a Firebase account and deploy your own Realtime Database.

Then you must create a `.env` file in your project that contains the following information:

```bash
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN='YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN_HERE'
VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL='YOUR_DATABASE_URL_HERE'
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID='YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE'
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET='YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET_HERE'
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID='YOUR_APP_ID_HERE'
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGE_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGE_SENDER_ID"
```
